# Firebase React Messages

This project was made using React, Firebase, and React-Bootstrap.

## About Project

I wanted to create a project to that used the different technologies that I have been learning. 
I chose firebase as a backend because how how quickly I could get it up and running.

### `Problems Solved`

While building out this application I ran into various issues.

  1. Live Updating Chatboard
    - I wanted a system similar to node/socket.io. 
      Google Firebase offered a similar type of user experience and was a lof faster to develop and push out code
  
  2. UI components
    - React Bootstrap offered a way to quickly use premade components. I added on to the styling via a css file.
    
   3. Log In
    - I needed a way to log in users to keep track of messages and who sent them. 
    Firebase offered a quick and easy way to accomplish this.

### `DEMO`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
